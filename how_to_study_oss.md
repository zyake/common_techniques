# How Study Open Source Softwares

1. Get an overview with documentation
2. Try it out and see if it works as expected
3. Check system calls using strace
4. Create flamegraph with perf to understand hotspots/paths and call hierarchy
5. Check resource usage such as CPU, storage, network, and memory using pidstat, vmstat, and ps
6. Take a quick look at the source codes based on the hotspot/path information
